                Hi, I am Jesmin Chakma. I graduated from Green University of Bangladesh in 2024. I am very passionate about software development. <br /><br />

                I have a strong foundation in <span className="text-orange-400">JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Redux, MongoDB, and Mongoose</span>. I have developed problem-solving and analytical thinking skills through projects, reading documentation, and taking courses. I continuously practice problem-solving on several online coding platforms like <span className="text-orange-400">LeetCode, HackerRank, and GreatFrontend.com</span> (easy to medium level problems). I am improving my web development skills by building projects on a daily basis. <br /><br />

                My main interest is to build scalable, robust, and optimized web solutions that provide great user experiences. As a person, I am dedicated, eager to learn, and keen on applying my technical skills to solve real-world problems and contribute to innovative projects. <br /><br />

                I enjoy playing chess, football, and badminton, traveling, reading storybooks, and playing video games.
